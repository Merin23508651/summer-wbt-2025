        <h2> CrystalOasis: A Luxurious Hotel Management System
        </h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I was actively involved in designing the graphical user interface (GUI) using Windows Forms
            and developing key modules like the customer dashboard, booking system, and payment functionality.I
            contributed to building a fully
            functional and user-friendly hotel management system that effectively met all real-life requirements.

        <h2>Smart Eco Tank System
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the Smart Eco Tank System project, I was actively involved in both hardware and software development. I
            contributed to designing the automatic water level monitoring system using sensors and microcontrollers. I
            worked on implementing features such as real-time water level detection, overflow
            prevention, and automated motor control. On the software side, I worked on integrating the system with the
            Blynk IoT platform, enabling remote monitoring through a mobile application. Additionally, I assisted in
            circuit design, sensor calibration, and testing for different environmental conditions. This project
            improved my understanding of embedded systems, sensor data handling, and real-time automation.

        <h2> Code-Based Secure Lock System

        </h2>
        <p>In this project, I was solely responsible for designing and assembling the complete security lock circuit
            using the Arduino Uno, a 4x4 matrix keypad, a relay module, and a 12V solenoid electric door lock. I
            programmed the system to display real-time status messages such as "Access Granted"
            or "Access Denied"—on a 16x2 serial LCD screen to enhance user interaction. By integrating all components on
            a breadboard and managing power through a 9V battery, I created a fully functional and compact prototype.
            This project helped me strengthen my skills in embedded system design, microcontroller programming, and
            security-based hardware development.

        <h2> Audio Amplifier
        </h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I was responsible for designing and assembling the complete audio amplifier circuit using
            core analog components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors. I calculated appropriate resistor values
            and configured the components based on circuit theory and Ohm’s Law to ensure optimal performance. I
            integrated an audio input jack to receive signals from external devices such as mobile phones and connected
            the output to a speaker. I used a power supply to energize the circuit and performed multiple test runs to
            fine-tune the audio quality, reducing unwanted noise and distortion.

        <h2>R-Tx Dinasor Game
        </h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed an interactive version of the RTX Dinosaur Run Game using an Arduino
            microcontroller and an OLED display. I programmed the core game logic in Arduino IDE, including character
            movement, obstacle generation, collision detection, and scoring mechanism. The graphics were carefully
            mapped and rendered on the OLED screen using pixel-by-pixel drawing functions. I integrated input buttons to
            allow real-time user control of the dinosaur character.
