        <h1> CrystalOasis: A Luxurious Hotel Management System
        </h1>
        <p>
            In this project, I was actively involved in designing the graphical user interface (GUI) using Windows Forms
            and developing key modules like the customer dashboard, booking system, and payment functionality. I
            collaborated closely with my teammates to integrate database operations, staff features, and ensure smooth
            user interaction. Working under the guidance of our course supervisor, I contributed to building a fully
            functional and user-friendly hotel management system that effectively met all real-life requirements. The
            project was well-received and successfully demonstrated our understanding of object-oriented programming and
            C# development.

        <h1>Smart Eco Tank System
        </h1>
        <p>
            In the Smart Eco Tank System project, I was actively involved in both hardware and software development. I
            contributed to designing the automatic water level monitoring system using sensors and microcontrollers. I
            worked on implementing features such as real-time water level detection, overflow
            prevention, and automated motor control. On the software side, I worked on integrating the system with the
            Blynk IoT platform, enabling remote monitoring through a mobile application. Additionally, I assisted in
            circuit design, sensor calibration, and testing for different environmental conditions. This project
            improved my understanding of embedded systems, sensor data handling, and real-time automation. It also
            enhanced my skills in teamwork, troubleshooting, and practical application of sustainable smart
            technologies.

        <h1> Code-Based Secure Lock System

        </h1>
        <p>In this project, I was solely responsible for designing and assembling the complete security lock circuit
            using the Arduino Uno, a 4x4 matrix keypad, a relay module, and a 12V solenoid electric door lock. I
            developed the embedded logic to validate numeric passcodes entered by the user, ensuring secure and accurate
            access control. I also programmed the system to display real-time status messages such as "Access Granted"
            or "Access Denied"—on a 16x2 serial LCD screen to enhance user interaction. By integrating all components on
            a breadboard and managing power through a 9V battery, I created a fully functional and compact prototype.
            This project helped me strengthen my skills in embedded system design, microcontroller programming, and
            security-based hardware development.

        <h1> Audio Amplifier
        </h1>
        <p>
            In this project, I was responsible for designing and assembling the complete audio amplifier circuit using
            core analog components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors. I calculated appropriate resistor values
            and configured the components based on circuit theory and Ohm’s Law to ensure optimal performance. I
            integrated an audio input jack to receive signals from external devices such as mobile phones and connected
            the output to a speaker. I used a power supply to energize the circuit and performed multiple test runs to
            fine-tune the audio quality, reducing unwanted noise and distortion. This hands-on experience deepened my
            understanding of signal amplification, analog electronics, and practical circuit troubleshooting.

        <h1>R-Tx Dinasor Game
        </h1>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed an interactive version of the RTX Dinosaur Run Game using an Arduino
            microcontroller and an OLED display. I programmed the core game logic in Arduino IDE, including character
            movement, obstacle generation, collision detection, and scoring mechanism. The graphics were carefully
            mapped and rendered on the OLED screen using pixel-by-pixel drawing functions. I integrated input buttons to
            allow real-time user control of the dinosaur character. The system was powered by a regulated power source
            and tested under different conditions to ensure smooth performance and minimal lag. This project enhanced my
            skills in embedded programming, real-time input handling, and graphical display interfacing with
            microcontrollers
